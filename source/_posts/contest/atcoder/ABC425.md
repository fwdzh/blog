### Editorial

We define 
$$
f(A, M, k) = \sum\limits_{x=0}^{M-1} \min_{i} (x \oplus A_i)
$$
Where $M$ is an interger not greater than $2^k$, and $A$ is a set of intergers whose elements are all less than $2^k$.

We can divede elements into two sets, with whose $k - 1$ th bit is $1$ and not. Define set $B_0 = \lbrace 0 \le x < 2 ^ {k -1 }|x \in  A\rbrace$, $B_1 = \lbrace 2 ^ {k - 1} \le x < 2 ^ k \rbrace$.

#### 1. if $M = 2 ^ k$

If $B_0$ and $B_1$
